	4. Look at tutorials on how to use it if you haven't before
4. Install Node packages
	1. Open up the terminal/console
	2. Change to the directory that contains the code for this repository
	3. Type `npm install`

### Directory Structure
- Markup written in [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) or HTML should be put in the `src/markup` directory.
- Scripts written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) or JavaScript should be put in the `src/scripts` directory.
- Styles written in [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) or CSS should be put in the `src/styles` directory.

### Testing
1. Open up the terminal/console
2. Change to the directory that contains the code for this repository
3. Type `grunt`
4. Open up the file you want to test from the `src` directory in your browser. For example you could type `open src/markup/index.html` to view the home page from the terminal

Note: you may want to use `grunt watch` so that you don't have to keep doing this process (this watches files waiting for you to save them and then does the build process) and you may also want to use a live page reloader so that you can view the page whilst you work.
